# Create a Registration Form

## Description
This lab demonstrates how to create a controlled form component in React.
We implemented a registration form for Little Lemon Restaurant with validation logic, password error handling, and form reset on submission.

## Tasks Completed
- Converted all form inputs into controlled components
- Implemented password validation with `isTouched` state
- Prevented default form submission behaviour

  - First name cannot be empty
  - Email must be valid and not empty
  - Password must be at least 8 characters
  - Role must be "individual" or "business"
- Implemented `clearForm` to reset the form after successful submission
- Verified the form in the browser
