# Passing Props

## Description
This lab demonstrates how to pass data to React components using props. Props allow components to be dynamic and reusable by sending data from a parent component to a child component.

## Tasks Completed
- Updated the `Heading` component to accept a `props` parameter
- Used `props.firstName` inside the `Heading` component to display dynamic content
- Passed the `firstName` prop from `App.js` to the `Heading` component
- Rendered multiple `Heading` components with different `firstName` values to demonstrate reusability
