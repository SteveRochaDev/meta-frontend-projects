# Managing State in React

## Description
This lab demonstrates how to lift state up in a React application. State is moved from a child component to a parent component so it can be shared across multiple components.

## Tasks Completed
- Moved the `fruits` state from the `Fruits` component to the `App` component
- Passed the `fruits` state as props to `Fruits` and `FruitsCounter`
- Rendered the list of fruits dynamically using `map`
- Calculated the total number of fruits dynamically using the array length

## Status
Lab completed successfully.  
**Grade:** 100%
