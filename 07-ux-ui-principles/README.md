# 07 - Principles of UX/UI Design

This course is part of the Meta Front-End Developer program.

The course explores the fundamentals of User Experience (UX) research and User Interface (UI) design. 
It covers methods to empathize with users, identify problems, iterate on designs, and test solutions. 
Core UX artifacts, such as user personas, are introduced, along with techniques to make informed design decisions.

UI design principles, including hierarchy, grids, and responsive layouts, are taught using Figma. 
Wireframes are created and transformed into Minimum Viable Product (MVP) style prototypes to practice real-world design workflows.

The course includes 5 modules with videos, readings, and assignments to practice the concepts. 
Topics include designing digital products that solve meaningful user problems, evaluating existing interfaces for consistency and quality, 
applying interaction design methods, and creating, sharing, and testing UX/UI designs following best practices.
