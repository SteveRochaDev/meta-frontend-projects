# Programming Assignment: Styling an HTML Page with CSS

## Introduction
This lab focuses on applying CSS to an HTML document to style a restaurant menu webpage. It introduces CSS selectors and properties to control the visual appearance of elements and align content.

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to practice using CSS selectors (element, ID, class, descendant) and properties to style a webpage. By the end of the lab, you will have a visually appealing Little Lemon menu page.

## Objectives
- Apply CSS rules using element, class, ID, and descendant selectors
- Align text and center images using CSS
- Style colors and font sizes to highlight content on the page

## Project Structure
- `index.html`
- `logo.png`
- `styles.css`

## Instructions

### Part 1: Style the HTML Page Using CSS
1. Open the `styles.css` file in the project folder.
2. Set the background color for the `body` element to `#E0E0E2`.
3. Style the main heading (`h1`) to have the color `#721817`.
4. Style the subheadings (`h2`) to have the same color `#721817`.
5. Add a `.center-text` class to center-align text inside elements with this class.
6. Center the logo image using the `#logo` ID: set `display: block` and `margin-left`/`margin-right` to `auto`.
7. Style all `span` elements directly inside `h2` elements to have color `#FA9F42` and font size `0.75em`.
8. Style the copyright text with the `#copyright` ID: add `padding-top: 12px` and font size `0.75em`.
9. Save the file.

### Part 2: Preview Your Styled Page
1. Start the live server by clicking **Go Live** in VS Code.
2. Note the exposed port number (e.g., `5500`).
3. Open the browser preview and navigate to: http://localhost:<port-number>
4. Verify that the styles are applied correctly: background color, text alignment, font colors, font sizes, and centered logo.
5. Stop the server after completing the lab.
