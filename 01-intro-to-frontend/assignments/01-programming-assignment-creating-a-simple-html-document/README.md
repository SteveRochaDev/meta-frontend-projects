# Programming Assignment: Creating a Simple HTML Document

## Introduction
This lab focuses on creating a basic HTML document and viewing it in a web browser using a local server. It introduces the foundational structure of an HTML5 document and helps build essential skills for web development.

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to understand how a valid HTML document is structured and how it can be previewed in a web browser. By completing this lab, you will create a simple webpage that displays text and learn how to run it using a local development server.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure of an HTML document  
- Create and structure a valid HTML5 file  
- Preview an HTML document in a web browser using a local server

## Project Structure

- `index.html`
- `README.md`

## Instructions

### Part 1: Creating the HTML Document
1. Open the `index.html` file in the project folder.
2. Add the HTML5 `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
3. Create the root `<html>` element.
4. Inside it, add a `<head>` element.
5. Within the `<head>`, add a `<title>` element with the text:
My First HTML Document
6. Add a `<body>` element.
7. Inside the body, display the text: I successfully created my first document
8. Save the file.

### Part 2: Viewing the HTML Document
1. Start the live server by clicking **Go Live** in VS Code.
2. Note the exposed port number (for example, `5500`).
3. Open the browser preview and navigate to: http://localhost:<port-number>
4. Verify that the text **“I successfully created my first document”** appears on the page.
5. Stop the server after completing the lab.

## Key Takeaways
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration enables HTML5 support.
- HTML documents follow a clear structure: `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- The `<title>` element defines the browser tab title.
- Visible content belongs inside the `<body>` element.
- Local servers allow quick previewing during development.
