# Programming Assignment: Building a Functional Program

## Introduction
This assignment focuses on practicing functional programming concepts in JavaScript. The goal is to create reusable functions that generate styled console messages using template literals, conditional logic, and the `%c` formatting feature of `console.log`.

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to strengthen understanding of functional programming by writing modular JavaScript functions that dynamically style and display console messages based on input parameters.

## Objectives
- Create reusable JavaScript functions for specific tasks.
- Use template literals and `%c` to style console output.
- Apply conditional logic using if-else statements.
- Combine multiple functions to build higher-level functionality.

## Project Structure
- `functionalprogramming.js`

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: Styled Console Message Generator
- Implement a `consoleStyler` function that:
  - Accepts color, background, font size, and text parameters.
  - Uses template literals to build style strings.
  - Logs styled messages to the console.

### Task 2: Celebratory Message Generator
- Implement a `celebrateStyler` function that:
  - Displays different messages based on the reason provided.
  - Uses conditional logic to handle multiple cases.

### Task 3: Function Invocation
- Invoke both `consoleStyler` and `celebrateStyler` with sample arguments to verify correct behavior.

### Task 4: Function Composition
- Implement `styleAndCelebrate` to:
  - Combine the functionality of both previous functions.
  - Demonstrate modular and reusable code design.

## Key Takeaways
- Functional programming promotes reusable and readable code.
- Template literals make string manipulation flexible and expressive.
- The `%c` directive enables styled console logging in JavaScript.
- Conditional logic allows functions to adapt behavior dynamically.
- Combining functions improves code modularity and scalability.
