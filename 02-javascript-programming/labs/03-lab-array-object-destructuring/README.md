# Lab: Working with Arrays and Objects – Destructuring Exercise

## Introduction
This lab focuses on JavaScript destructuring, a modern syntax feature that allows extracting values from arrays and objects in a concise and readable way. Destructuring helps reduce repetitive code and improves clarity when working with structured data.

## Goal
The goal of this lab is to understand and apply array and object destructuring, and to use the extracted values effectively inside template literals.

## Objectives
- Understand and apply array destructuring to extract specific elements.
- Understand and apply object destructuring to extract specific properties.
- Use destructured values inside template literals.
- Improve code readability using modern JavaScript syntax.
- Practice debugging common destructuring mistakes.

## Project Structure
- `array_destructuring.js`
- `object_destructuring.js`

## Instructions
1. Open `array_destructuring.js` in the PROJECT folder.
2. Use array destructuring to extract the second product’s name and price from the products array.
3. Log the extracted values using template literals.
4. Open `object_destructuring.js`.
5. Use object destructuring to extract the `author`, `title`, and `timePosted` properties from the review object.
6. Log a formatted sentence using the destructured values.
7. Run the code to verify the output matches the expected result.

## Key Takeaways
- Array destructuring simplifies extracting specific elements from arrays.
- Object destructuring provides a clean and concise way to access object properties.
- Template literals work seamlessly with destructured variables.
- Destructuring reduces repetition and improves code maintainability.
- Modern JavaScript syntax leads to clearer and more expressive code.
