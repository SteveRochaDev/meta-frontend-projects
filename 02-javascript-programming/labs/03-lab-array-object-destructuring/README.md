# Lab: Working with Arrays and Objects – Destructuring

## Introduction
This lab focuses on practicing array and object destructuring in JavaScript. The goal is to extract specific values from arrays and objects and use them in template literals to generate meaningful output.

## Objectives
- Apply array destructuring to extract nested values.
- Apply object destructuring to access specific properties.
- Use template literals to build dynamic strings.
- Improve code readability and clarity using modern JavaScript syntax.

## Project Structure
- `array_destructuring.js`
- `object_destructuring.js`

## Key Takeaways
- Array destructuring simplifies extracting values from nested arrays.
- Object destructuring provides a concise way to access object properties.
- Template literals improve readability when combining dynamic values.
- Destructuring leads to cleaner and more maintainable JavaScript code.
