# Lab: JavaScript Essentials – Spread, Rest, and Concise Array Operations

## Introduction
This lab focuses on practicing the spread and rest operators in JavaScript. The goal is to simplify handling arrays and function arguments by using these modern ES6 features.

## Goal
Learn how to:
- Separate array elements into individual variables and subarrays.
- Handle an unknown number of function arguments.
- Merge multiple arrays concisely using the spread operator.

## Objectives
- Apply array destructuring with the spread operator.
- Use the rest operator to manage variable function arguments.
- Merge arrays into a single array using the spread operator.
- Write cleaner, more concise, and dynamic JavaScript code.

## Project Structure
- `spread_operator.js`
- `rest_operator.js`
- `merge_array.js`

## Instructions
1. Open `spread_operator.js` and destructure the first three restaurants into variables and the remaining into a subarray. Log all values.
2. Open `rest_operator.js` and implement the `unknownArgs` function using the rest operator. Iterate and log all arguments passed to it.
3. Open `merge_array.js` and merge the baseball and football team arrays using the spread operator. Log the resulting array.
4. Run all three files to verify the outputs.

## Key Takeaways
- The spread operator `...` expands array elements into individual items.
- The rest operator `...args` collects multiple function arguments into an array.
- Using spread for merging arrays avoids loops and manual concatenation.
- Modern ES6 syntax improves code readability and maintainability.
- Mastering these operators simplifies common programming tasks and reduces boilerplate.
