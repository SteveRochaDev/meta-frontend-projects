# 05 - Create a Repository with Forking

## Objective
Practice version control by forking a repository, creating a branch, committing changes, and opening a pull request.

## Files
- `class.md` – file used to add your information and practice changes.

## Steps Completed
1. Authenticated GitHub CLI using `gh auth login`.
2. Created an authentication token in GitHub and verified authorization.
3. Forked the class repository to my account.
4. Cloned the forked repository locally.
5. Navigated into the repository directory.
6. Created and checked out a new branch `my-branch`.
7. Edited `class.md` to add my first name, location, and the certification name.
8. Added the changes using `git add`.
9. Committed the changes with the message: `minor changes`.
10. Pushed the branch to my fork on GitHub.
11. Opened a pull request from my fork to the main class repository.
12. Copied the pull request ID after creation.

## Key Takeaways
- Learned to fork a repository to create an independent copy.
- Practiced creating branches and committing changes without affecting the main repository.
- Opened a pull request to merge changes from a forked repository.
- Reinforced proper workflow for collaborative version control.

**Note:** This lab simulates the fork and pull request workflow within this repository. All changes have been merged into the `main` branch.

## Status
Lab completed successfully.  
**Grade:** 100%
