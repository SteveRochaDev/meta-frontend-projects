This course is part of the Meta Front-End Developer program.

The focus of this course is on **version control** and collaborative software development. 
It covers using Git and GitHub to manage code revisions, create repositories, and establish 
effective workflows. Basic **Linux commands** and file management techniques are also 
introduced to automate tasks and streamline development processes.

The course includes 4 modules, featuring videos, readings and assignments to practice 
version control concepts and workflows.
