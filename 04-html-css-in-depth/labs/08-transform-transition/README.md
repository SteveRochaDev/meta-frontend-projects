## Description
In this lab, we practiced using CSS `transform` and `transition` properties. Each letter inside `.letters` elements has specific styling, and upon hovering over the `.letters` container, even and odd `p` elements rotate on different axes for a dynamic effect.

## Key Concepts
- CSS descendant selectors
- CSS pseudo-classes with `:hover`
- CSS `nth-child()` selector
- CSS `transform` and `transition` properties
- Rotations along X and Y axes
