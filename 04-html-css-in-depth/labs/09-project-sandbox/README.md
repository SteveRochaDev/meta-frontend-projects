## Project Sandbox

This is a personal sandbox to experiment with HTML and CSS.

### Notes
- You can use this sandbox multiple times but only for one hour at a time.
- Make sure to download your files to your computer before the session ends.
- To continue working later, copy and paste the HTML and CSS code into the template files provided in the sandbox.
