# Lab: Semantic HTML – Enhancing Web Page Accessibility and Structure

## Introduction
Semantic HTML plays a crucial role in creating accessible, readable, and maintainable web pages. By using meaningful tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`, developers provide structure and context to web content that benefits both users and assistive technologies.

This lab focuses on refactoring a non-semantic webpage into a semantic one without changing its content or visual layout.
